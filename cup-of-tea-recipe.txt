Ingredients:
 - 1 tea bag
 - 30-50ml milk
 - 1g sugar

 Directions:
 Add tea bag to cup and pour milk onto tea bag. Ensure all of the tea bag is covered by the milk as this will prevent tea dust sitting on the top. Add sugar to taste. Add "just-off-the-boil" water to the cup. Leave to brew for up to 5 minutes, then remove tea bag and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Consume. Make a satisfied sound such as "Aaaah!" or "Ooooh!". Smile at your achievement.
